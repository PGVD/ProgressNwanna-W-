**VERSION CONTROL** is a system that tracks changes to files over time, allowing you to revert to previous versions, compare changes, and collaborate effectively. It's essential for software development, writing, design, and any project where you want to manage multiple versions of files.

**Git** is a version control system that runs on your computer. It allows you to create repositories (folders for your project files) and track changes within them.
**GitHub** is a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories. It provides a platform for sharing, collaborating, and managing Git projects with others.

**GitHub Alternatives** are;
**GitLab**: Offers similar features to GitHub with a focus on continuous integration and deployment.
**Bitbucket**: Popular among enterprise teams, integrates well with Atlassian tools like Jira and Confluence.
**Azure DevOps**: Microsoft's platform, integrates with other Azure services and supports various development methodologies.

**Git Fetch**: Downloads new commits from a remote repository to your local machine, but doesn't merge them into your current branch.
**Git Pull**: Combines fetch and merge, both downloading new commits and merging them into your current branch.

**Git Rebase** rewrites the history of your branch by moving your commits to a new base commit. It's often used to create a linear history or incorporate changes from another branch without merge commits.
**Command**: git rebase (base_branch)

**Git Cherry-pick** applies a specific commit from one branch onto another. It's useful for picking out individual changes without merging entire branches.
**Command**: git cherry-pick (commit_hash)
